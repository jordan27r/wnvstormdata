# wnvstormdata

The data provided in `wnvstormdata` integrates weekly data on tropical
cyclone exposure and West Nile Virus incidence for parishes in Louisiana
from 2002–2021 to determine if a storm occurred in each parish for the
observed week. This data set provides researchers interested in the
association between vector-borne disease prevalence and hurricanes with
data on cases numbers and when hurricane exposure took place paired by
location and time interval.
