The data provided in `wnvstormdata` integrates weekly data on tropical cyclone exposure and West Nile Virus incidence for parishes in Louisiana from 2002--2021 to determine if a storm occurred in each parish for the observed week. This data set provides researchers interested in the association between vector-borne disease prevalence and hurricanes with data on cases numbers and when hurricane exposure took place paired by location and time interval.
