This report presents currently available information about arboviral diseases in Louisiana. Cases of human infection and instances of positive mosquito testing
can be used to understand the burden, risk, timing, and geographic distribution of arboviral diseases in the state.

Arboviral diseases can be divided into two main categories: imported and endemic. Imported arboviral diseases are instances where individuals test positive for
an infection after travelling to another country. These diseases are not typically transmitted within Louisiana and are not circulating in local mosquito populations.
The imported arboviral diseases included in this report are chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. Endemic arboviral diseases are infections which occur in Louisiana,
such as Eastern Equine Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, and West Nile Virus. West Nile (WN) is the most common arboviral disease in the state and has
been actively transmitted since it was first detected in 2002.

Laboratories and health care providers report cases of arboviral diseases to the Office of Public Health under the State Sanitary Code. However, not all cases are
able to be detected. Between 80-90% of all WN cases are asymptomatic, meaning these individuals would not seek testing. Occasionally these asymptomatic
cases are detected through blood donation testing (PVD). Many symptomatic cases can be mild to moderate flu-like illnesses (West Nile Fever), and might not
seek medical care or be tested. Only a small fraction of cases develop neuroinvasive disease (NID), which includes meningitis and encephalitis. People ages 65
and older are at higher risk for NID. Due to the severe nature of these cases, they are consistently detected and reported.

Since such a small percentage of human infections are detected, it is also important to monitor mosquito populations. Every year 20,000-50,000 mosquito pools
(aggregate samples of 50+ mosquitoes from the same sample site) from approximately 30 parishes are submitted for testing. These mosquitos are tested for
endemic viruses in order to detect when and where viruses are transmitted.

* Human cases are reported by LDH Region. Please see Regional Map on next page for reference. Parish counts are included on the year-end report.
Note: Not all parishes collect and test mosquito pools for virus activity. The information provided in this report should be used to infer statewide and regional trends and activity of virus
transmission. If a parish is not included on this report, that does not mean that arbovirus transmission is not ocurring in that area.
