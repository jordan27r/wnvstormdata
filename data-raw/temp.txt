This report presents currently available information about arboviral diseases in Louisiana. Cases of human infection and
instances of positive mosquito testing can be used to understand the burden, risk, timing, and geographic distribution of
arboviral diseases in the state.

Arboviral diseases can be divided into two main categories: imported and endemic. Imported arboviral diseases are
instances where individuals test positive for an infection after travelling to another country. These diseases are not
typically transmitted within Louisiana and are not circulating in local mosquito populations. The imported arboviral
diseases included in this report are chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. Endemic arboviral diseases are infections which
occur in Louisiana, such as Eastern Equine Encephalitis, St. Louis Encephalitis, and West Nile Virus. West Nile Virus is the
most common arboviral disease in the state and has been actively transmitted since it was first detected in 2002.

Laboratories and health care providers report cases of arboviral diseases to the Office of Public Health under the State
Sanitary Code. However, not all cases are able to be detected. Between 80-90% of all WNV cases are asymptomatic,
meaning these individuals would not seek testing. Occasionally these asymptomatic cases are detected through blood
donation testing (PVD - Presumptive Viremic Donors), who are then interviewed to determine if they developed
symptoms. Many symptomatic cases can be mild to moderate flu-like illnesses (West Nile Fever), and might not seek
medical care or be tested. Only a small fraction of cases develop neuroinvasive disease (NID), which includes meningitis
and encephalitis. People ages 65 and older are at higher risk for NID. Due to the severe nature of these cases, they are
consistently detected and reported.

Since such a small percentage of human infections are detected, it is also important to monitor mosquito populations.
Every year 20,000-50,000 mosquito pools (aggregate samples of 50+ mosquitoes from the same sample site) from
approximately 30 parishes are submitted to the Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (LSU - LADDL) for
testing. These mosquitos are tested for endemic viruses in order to detect when and where viruses are transmitted.

Note: Not all parishes collect and test mosquito pools for virus activity. The information provided in this report should be
used to infer statewide and regional trends and activity of virus transmission. If a parish is not included on this report, that
does not mean that arbovirus transmission is not ocurring in that area. Only mosquito pools tested at LADDL are included
on this report.
