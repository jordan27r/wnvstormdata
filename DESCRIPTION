Description: The dataset provided by 'wnvstormdata' consists of weekly West Nile Virus 
        case data per parish in Lousiana from 2002-2021. These weekly observations have
        been linked with NOAA storm data by time and geographic location to determine
        storm exposure. If a storm with winds of at least 34 knots occursed during the 
        observation week within the parish, it is considered an exposure. This data can
        be used to research associations between hurricanes and vector borne diseases.
